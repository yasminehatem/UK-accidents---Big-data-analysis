This is a big data project for applying data visualization , time series and classification models on kaggle UK accidents datsaets dataset 
* Objective
* Datasets

# Objective
This project is divided to 3 parts 
- Visualizing the data using ggplot to see the frequency of the attributes affecting the accidents
- Predicting the severity of the accident using 3 built-in models 
   1. naive bayes classifier using libraries e1071 and caret
   2. Neural networks using library nnet
   3. Random forest using library randomForest

- Forecasting the number of accidents in the next few months 

# Datasets
This project was built using [Kaggle UK accidents datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales?fbclid=IwAR0dGYRO__sdeIfxN0T-2pLgnHB2wYj1A3IY23ix5siPDjMO4-GvUYDP5QU)
